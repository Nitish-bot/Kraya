## Brand Voice

#### Todoist:
- meet
- Questionnaire
- opinions on last meet
- scrutiny on proposed values and mission
#### Examples

>Oldspice tweet: 
>Scent-A-CIaus is real. He is definitely not just a holiday spokesguy we made up so that Isaiah Mustafa could tell you about the Old Spice Swagger Holiday Pack.
	Funny, casual, absurd

>Nike campaign:
>If they think your dreams are crazy, show them what crazy dreams can do.
>	Serious, powerful, encouraging

>Duolingo use of their owl as a motivator to keep studying. It became a meme and although very casual but worked very well for them.

>Volvo: 60 Years. Over a million lives saved. The 3-point seatbelt invented by volvo.
>	Serious, impactful, shows off how much importance they put in safety

>Skittles: We need your help today!
>Vote SKITTLES for best brand on twitter so we can keep our jobs.

#### What's so special?

All the brands make sure they have a distinct personality and do not conform to the norms set by the industry. 

Old spice doesnt do generic ladkiya mil jaegi sexy smell karo.
Skittles dont try to focus on sweetness or mithaas in moments, it focuses on unique flavors. Skittles posts make you go "They really posted that?"

#### What's next 

- Audience mapping with their voice
- Define core values (about 3 to 10)
- Company goals, plan to achieve them, audience and what/how should your company be known
	Companies dont necessarily need to have a mission in their own domain. Most companies' values lie where their founders' values lie. Grounds & Hounds is a coffee brand that donates 20% to rescuing animals.
	MyMuse has it's values in "live and let live". Even tho not directly related to the brand, they are trying to destigmatize their products and promote individuality
- Fill the templates for Brand voice, tone of voice and brand personality

#### Questionnaire

- How did ayush explain kraya to you (the pitch)
- Give me 3 adjectives pertaining to what kraya is and what it is trying to become (it's okay if you think there are overlaps)
- What do you think kraya's values are? if you know any
	what about the mission? what problem is kraya trying to solve
- If kraya was a person which of these things do you imagine it saying:
	Look between CAPS LOCK and RETURN on your keyboard. That’s the alphabet. Use it to write an original joke

	Giving your mom flowers isn't a replacement for kraya coupon

	We like our tweets the way we like our clothing: hot, bold and better than anyone expects from an instagram brand.

	humaare paas ek kapde ki dukaan hai kiraaye pe leni ho toh batana
	address : https://www.kraya.com/lowest-kiraya

	due to unforeseen circumstances, anybody who orders today will get 200 coins in their wallet!
	please please dont embarass me (say you shop from bewakoof)

#### Way forward

ref: 
	Moonpie (self-deprecating, extremely honest, thats what wins hearts
	![[Pasted image 20240702174206.png]]	

	Oldspice (funny but respectful and also randomly unhinged eg: snakes hit abs everday) 

	wendys (extremely irreverant, honest and maybe a little over the top humor)

##### Key point
Why all this? To give structure to the company's personality and maintain consistency
Why 
Use 'I' to show a person behind instead of corporate lingo 
Indian brands are too afraid of taking shots or calling names, they continuously interact with and tweet @bk or @mcd which again shows they're not afraid of being themselves and it feels like a person behind instead of a corporation

##### Core values 
- We are committed to elevation
- We fear stagnation
- We celebrate the individual in all of us (we celebrate individuality)
- We believe cooperation is the fabric of community. (Because people will never love a company unless it's employees love it first    -simon sinek)
- We resent bombastic grandiose(we don't like to take ourselves too seriously)
- And when the going gets rough (when we are in difficult times), we put our faith in light-heartedness and humor.

#### Way forward pt2

##### The what?
We have a business, the goal is to build a brand. A business is an **organization** that trades goods and/or services for money. Now, the problem is an organization is an entity with no feelings, emotions or personality. A brand is what keeps it from being perceived that way. It's not just how your customers see you but how anybody that interacts with your brand will see it, including the people that work with you..

As is the narrative with most startups, Kraya is like a baby, in order to enable it's growth we need to raise Kraya like we would a child. The foundations are already done, although there is a long way to go and lot of in depth exploration for it to do, Kraya has already found a lot of it's principles and what it seeks to do but it is still young and we need to make sure we don't set our child up for failure and that means, not putting it in tight boxes, !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! not seeing ourselves in it but instead seeing it in us.

##### The why?
- 84% people believe business leaders have a responsibility to speak out on social and political issues
- 61% people believe companies should be doing as much as they can to prevent environmental harm
- In 2013 an average of 42% people agreed to the statement "I tend to buy brands that reflect my personal values", this number increased to 61% in 2021. 
Source: [The world economic forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/12/people-prefer-brands-with-aligned-corporate-purpose-and-values/)
The trend is clear and we as a business need to follow suit (esp if we are in the business of selling).

##### The how?
By showing the user that Kraya solves a problem that they care about. So, what problems do they care about:
- climate change **
- self-expression (embrace their style without feeling conscious - feel empowered)
- trouble finding unique quality products
- too much friction between discovering and finally receiving the product
- no interest in the brand but instead in the product (a problem for both of us)
- tired of same old marketing based on discounts and fake promises

##### Core values:
- Kraya is a celebration of individuality.
- We don't like to take ourselves too serious
- We believe people go further when they go together.
- When growth feels like party, you're at the right place.
- And when the going gets rough (when we are in difficult times), we put our faith in light-heartedness and humor.

Mission: To transform how you discover, accelerate your journey, and to have fun doing it all.

##### Why so serious?
Galt ghadi bhi din mein 2 baar sahi hoti hai, hum wo galt ghadi hai, different from the norm, carefree, irreverant and not afraid to be sarcastic but core values and mission are the two places jaha hum sahi hone waale hai. Ranveer singh has a very vivid persona but that's his brand and the real ranveer singh is a [different person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sMfQxBdP_g) Which is not to say his brand is fake but that there's more to it than meets the eye. 
Similarly, mark mason's book 'subtle art of not giving a fuck' is a title made to stir things up and grab those eyeballs but the book is nothing like it, it doesn't tell you stop caring about the world and spit in everybody's faces, it's deeper than that, the book speaks more or less on the idea ['if it wont matter in 3 years, dont give it another thought'.](https://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck)
In embodying these personas and more, we have to realize our brand values and mission dictate how our brand will present itself, these are foundations to our brand not the entire brand itself. This what we will come back to time and time again and this is what will dictate how our brand will present itself and be perceived.

Seller storefront ka thoda tooltips likh do

##### IG strategy
They recommend 3-5 posts a week, reels (videos) tend to do better as IG has become more for reels than for scrolling posts. When making a post 5-8 laser focused hashtags
Also, Engage with other users - follow, comment, like. When they (IG algorithm) see you as an active community member, that seems to somehow make them reccomend you more.

IG “tests” your profile out to “focus” groups of accounts, If the click rate or watch rate is high in groups A, B, and F (for example) it'll recommend you more in those areas. Which gets you followers and IG recommending you more often in those areas and trials in others. But if its low in the other areas, C, D and E, or all together, it’ll not promote you as much until it goes through the “focus groups” again.

We need to be in a niche! We cannot take everything with a fan following and everything with the potential for virality and put it together on Kraya, this will only make it confusing for the viewer and our posts will not be targeting the groups we want , we might get viral but not in the space we want to.
Simple fix is, we want to make content that we would consumes, and nothing less than that should go on our page.

But don't worry, aap iss video ko dekhna regret nahi karoge, poore campus ke around humne 100 se bhi zyada kraya posters chupaye hain, agar aapko ye posters milein toh usse humaare pas MINI OAT lekar aaiye and I'll give you a cute little gift"

- Kya aapki life mein validation ki kami hai? (group of people go "HAA") kya aapko koi truly appreciate nahi karta? (group of women go "HAA") kya aapko chahiye ek bohot bada ego boost? (group of men go "HAA bhyi HAA"), toh aajaiye 18 19 aur 20 tareekh ko DTU, na sirf hum aap sabhi ko boht saara affirmation denge but you can also stand a chance to win ten thousand rupees, aarhe ho na?
